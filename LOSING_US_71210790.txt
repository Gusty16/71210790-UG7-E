Losing Us â€“ Raisa Anggiani

I love you more than it showed
And you said you feel it too
Thought it was a happy ending
But now it's just beginning

And then you leave me all behind
And you say, "Don't come back again"
And I said

lirik lagu bitang kecil
Bintang kecil, di langit yang tinggi  
Amat banyak, menghias angkasa
Aku ingin, terbang dan menari
jauh tinggi ke tempat kau berada
